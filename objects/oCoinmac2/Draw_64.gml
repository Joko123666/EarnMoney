/// @description Drawing code moved to the Draw Event

// The drawing logic for this object, including the UI panel and all its elements,
// has been moved to the Draw Event (Draw_0.gml).
// This allows the entire machine and its UI to be drawn in world space and scroll with the camera.
// This file is intentionally left blank.
